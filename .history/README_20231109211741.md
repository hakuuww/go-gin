This repo is some code I wrote by following a video tutorial to learn how to use the basic functionalities in the go-gin framework to build basic REST APIs.

Will be helpful for building my sideproject in mind.

The code allows a user to add movies, search for movies, delete movies and modify movies by sending http requests.

The code also touches on how middlewares work in gin.

After completing this repo, I now have a general picture on REST APIs, HTTP methods. It also reinforced my understanding on topics such as interfaces, packages, modules, mutexes
